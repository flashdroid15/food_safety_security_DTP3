# Design Thinking Project Title  
Modelling Food Safety and Food Security using Excel and Python Language Programming

# Design thinking Project Scenario
The world will need to feed 9 billion people by 2050 _(Godfray et. al 2010)_, and to do so through safe, sustainable food chains. Access by all – especially the poor and vulnerable – to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food is an issue of increasing urgency and a key Sustainable Development Goal _(Goal 2: Zero Hunger)_. How can a humanistic approach to data-driven modelling help to solve some of the challenges related to food security and safety? 

## Defining Food Safety and Food Security
Food security refers to the adequate supply of safe and nutritious food for all to lead healthy and active lives. Food safety, in general, refers to the handling, preparation and storage of food to prevent illness and injury. In this sense, food safety is an important component of food security. The problems of food safety and food security are interrelated _(Hanning et. al. 2012)_. Without food safety systems to assure access to food without pathogens and contaminants, food security is diminished. The factors relating to climate change, political governance, geopolitical and cultural conflicts, technological advancements (or lack thereof), biodiversity loss, agricultural practices, migration movements, sanitation, are just some of the many multidimensional issues that impact both food safety and security _(King et. al. 2017)_
